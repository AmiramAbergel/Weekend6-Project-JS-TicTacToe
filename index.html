                Tic-Tac-Toe is probably something you've played before.
                <br />The game is pretty simple, isn't it? That's what most
                people think.<br />
                However, if you think about it carefully, you'll find that it's
                not as easy as it seems! Unlike a lot of other games,
                tic-tac-toe requires you to look ahead and anticipate what the
                other player might do.<br />
                RULES FOR TIC-TAC-TOE<br />
                1. The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
                <br />
                2. Your friend (or the computer in this case) is X, and you are
                O. <br />
                Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.<br />
                3. Players who get 3 marks (up, down, across, or diagonally) in
                a row win. <br />
                4. The game ends when all 9 squares are filled. A game ends in a
                tie if no one has three marks in a row.
